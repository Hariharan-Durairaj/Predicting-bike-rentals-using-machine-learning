# Predicting Bike Rentals Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project is focused on predicting the number of bike rentals based on various features using machine learning algorithms. The notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of loading data, preprocessing it, training machine learning models, evaluating performance, and visualizing results.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Insights into the dataset, identifying patterns, and handling missing values.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature engineering, encoding, and normalization.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use of metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for assessing performance.
- **Visualization:** Plots to understand data distributions, model results, and feature importance.
